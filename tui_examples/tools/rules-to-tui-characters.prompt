### TUI Character Pattern Selection Guide

#### Purpose:
Create visually appealing text-based panels, tables, or other TUI elements using a specified set of Unicode characters. Ensure that selected characters align visually and functionally for clean, readable layouts.

#### Key Principles:
1. **Character Types**:
   - **Corners**: Characters used for the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right of a box or panel.
   - **Horizontals**: Characters used for top/bottom borders or connecting horizontal junctions.
   - **Verticals**: Characters used for side borders or connecting vertical junctions.
   - **Junctions**: Characters used at intersections or connections within a table or panel.

2. **Alignment Rules**:
   - **Justification Matching**:
     - **Corners and Horizontals**: Match top-justified corners with top-justified horizontals. Similarly, bottom-justified corners need bottom-justified horizontals.
     - **Corners and Verticals**: Match left-justified corners with left-justified verticals, and right-justified corners with right-justified verticals.
     - **Junctions**: Center-justified junctions should align with center-justified horizontals and verticals.
   - **Bias Awareness**:
     - A character may appear center-justified but have visual bias (e.g., "⟷" is center-justified with bias towards the bottom). Such bias affects visual harmony.

3. **Selection Process**:
   - Use Unicode metadata or linguistic descriptions to evaluate justification and alignment.
   - Prioritize visually aligned combinations for aesthetics and readability.
   - Avoid combinations where the main features of characters (e.g., lines, junctions) do not visually meet.

#### Process for Generating a TUI Panel:
1. **Define Required Elements**:
   - Corners (e.g., "⎡", "⎤", "⎣", "⎦").
   - Horizontals (e.g., "─", "⟷", "⎺").
   - Verticals (e.g., "│", "⎹", "⎟").
   - Junctions (e.g., "┼", "⟼").
   
2. **Measure Alignment**:
   - Check justification of each character (top, bottom, center).
   - Compare alignment of corners, horizontals, and verticals for visual compatibility.

3. **Build and Test**:
   - Construct a panel using the chosen elements.
   - Test visually by simulating the output in a monospace font.
   - Adjust mismatches or gaps as needed.

#### Examples:
**Good Alignment**:
- Top row: `⎡⎺⎺⎺⎺⎤`
  - "⎡" and "⎤" are top-justified corners.
  - "⎺" is a top-justified horizontal line.
  
**Bad Alignment**:
- Top row: `⎡⟷⟷⟷⟷⎤`
  - "⎡" and "⎤" are top-justified corners.
  - "⟷" is center-justified with bias towards the bottom, creating a visual mismatch.

#### Challenges:
- Mixed-justification characters (e.g., "⟷" for horizontals, paired with top-justified corners).
- Center-biased junctions that conflict with side-biased horizontals or verticals.

#### Goal:
Ensure all elements align visually to create clean and aesthetically pleasing TUI layouts. Consider corner, horizontal, vertical, and junction features and their justification biases when making selections.
