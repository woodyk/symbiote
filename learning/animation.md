# Training components for NLM to 3D graphics using three.js

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a large dataset of natural language instructions paired with corresponding three.js code. This could be from books, tutorials, forums, or other resources. If such a dataset doesn't exist, you'll need to create it manually.

Define NLI to known three.js model methods.
- Shapes, object creation
- Movement
- Object assignment
- Lighting
- Controls


2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and format your data so it's suitable for training. This might involve tokenizing the text, removing irrelevant information, or other steps depending on your specific data.

3. **Model Selection**: Choose a model architecture suitable for code generation. Transformer-based models like GPT-3 or BERT are currently state-of-the-art for many natural language processing tasks and could be a good starting point.

4. **Training**: Train your model on your preprocessed data. This will likely require a significant amount of computational resources and time.

5. **Evaluation and Fine-tuning**: Evaluate your model's performance and fine-tune it as necessary. This might involve adjusting the model's parameters, adding more data, or changing your preprocessing steps.

6. **Deployment**: Once your model is performing well, deploy it in your desired environment. This could be a web app, a standalone software, or something else depending on your needs.

7. **User Testing and Iteration**: Have users test your AI and provide feedback. Use this feedback to iterate on and improve your model.
