    ### Full Analysis: Rendering Panels with Mixed-Sized Characters in the Console

    #### Algorithm Overview
    This algorithm is designed to create visually consistent TUI (Terminal User
    Interface) elements like panels, tables, and boxes, even when the
    characters used have mixed sizes. It calculates the required padding and
    alignment to make all rows in the rendered object have the same width,
    ensuring a professional and clean look.

    #### Steps in the Algorithm:
    1. **Define the Object Dimensions**:
       - Specify the width, height, text content, and the characters used for
         borders, corners, and filler spaces.

    2. **Measure Character Widths**:
       - Identify the visual width of each character type:
         - Borders (`border_char`) may be narrower than monospace characters.
         - Decorations (`corner_char`) may be wider than other characters.

    3. **Calculate Top Row Width**:
       - The first row usually contains corner decorations and borders. Its
         length defines the total width of the object.
       - Use the formula:
         ```
         top_row_width = (corner_char_width * 2) + (inner_width * border_multiplier)
         ```
       - The `border_multiplier` adjusts for smaller or larger border
         characters.

    4. **Align All Rows**:
       - Subsequent rows must match the width of the top row.
       - For rows without corner decorations (e.g., middle rows):
         - Add padding (`indent`) to the left and right based on the size of
           the corner decorations.
         - Ensure each row aligns with the top row using `.ljust()` or string
           padding.

    5. **Center Content**:
       - Text in the panel should be centered within the inner width.
       - Calculate left and right padding for the text:
         ```
         total_padding = inner_width - len(text)
         left_padding = total_padding // 2
         right_padding = total_padding - left_padding
         ```

    6. **Render the Object**:
       - Combine all parts into a consistent, visually aligned structure:
         - Top border (with corners).
         - Middle rows (indented or centered).
         - Text rows (centered).
         - Bottom border (with corners).

    #### Guidelines for Creating TUI Objects:
    - **Choose Characters Wisely**:
      - Use visually distinct characters for borders and corners.
      - Ensure filler characters (e.g., spaces) don't overpower text or
        borders.

    - **Account for Mixed Sizes**:
      - Always measure the width of non-standard characters relative to
        monospace characters (e.g., Braille ⠤ is ~0.5x width of a regular
        monospace character).

    - **Align to Longest Row**:
      - Calculate the total width of the longest row (usually the top or
        bottom) and ensure all rows match this width.

    - **Dynamic Adjustments**:
      - Allow corner and border decorations to vary in size, adjusting
        padding accordingly.

        # Step 1: Measure character widths
        border_width_ratio = 0.5  # Example: Border char is half-width
        corner_width = len(corner_char)

        # Step 2: Calculate top row width
        border_multiplier = int(1 / border_width_ratio)
        inner_width = (width - 2) * border_multiplier

        height=7,

    #### Simple Explanation for a 5th Grader:
    1. **Think of the Panel as a Picture Frame**:
       - The frame has a top, bottom, and sides, just like the borders of a 
         panel.
       - The corners are like decorations on the edges of the frame.

    2. **Measure the Width of the Top Row**:
       - The top of the frame is the widest part. Make sure everything else 
         fits the same width.

    3. **Make Sure the Middle is the Same Width**:
       - Add extra spaces (padding) on the left and right of each row to make 
         them just as wide as the top.

    4. **Center the Words**:
       - Put your text in the middle of the frame. Add spaces on each side of 
         the words to keep them in the center.

    5. **Print It All Together**:
       - Start with the top border.
       - Add the middle rows (empty rows or rows with text).
       - Finish with the bottom border.

    #### Key Points:
    - Always measure how wide the decorations and borders are.
    - Add spaces (padding) to make all rows the same width.
    - Keep the text centered and aligned.
