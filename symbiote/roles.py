Example: 
user: I would like to work on a new business project that involves a new product that helps women with holding their hair up.  I want to create a special clip that allows women to twirrel their hair up into a bun very easily. 
  
assistant: Sure, without any detail here is a suggestion on how that might work.  Twist the hair in a long strand, place a band at the end.  Instert a nice stick at the ba
se of the band and twist into a bun.  Do you think this is a good idea? How do you think the mechanism would work?
 
user: I like that idea. Let's add a clip to the top of the stick insterted so that after the bund is made it is held in place. 
 
assistant: Great, here are three concepts that might help
 with that. 
1. --- 
2. --- 
3. --- 
We might need to add X, Y and Z to make the twist look better.  Which option would you like?
