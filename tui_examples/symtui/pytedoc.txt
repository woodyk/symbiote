pyte.streams This module provides three stream implementations with different features; for starters, here’s a quick example of how streams are typically used:  >>> import pyte >>> screen = pyte.Screen(80, 24) >>> stream = pyte.Stream(screen) >>> stream.feed("[5B")  # Move the cursor down 5 rows. >>> screen.cursor.y 5 copyright:	 2011-2012 by Selectel. copyright:	 (c) 2012-2017 by pyte authors and contributors, see AUTHORS for details.  license:	 LGPL, see LICENSE for more details.  pyte.Stream classpyte.Stream(screen=None, strict=True)[source] A stream is a state machine that parses a stream of bytes and dispatches events based on what it sees.  Parameters:	 screen (pyte.screens.Screen) – a screen to dispatch events to. strict (bool) – check if a given screen implements all required events. Note  Stream only accepts text as input, but if for some reason you need to feed it with bytes, consider using ByteStream instead.  See also  man console_codes For details on console codes listed bellow in basic, escape, csi, sharp. pyte.ByteStream classpyte.ByteStream(*args, **kwargs)[source] A stream which takes bytes as input.  Bytes are decoded to text using either UTF-8 (default) or the encoding selected via select_other_charset().  use_utf8 Assume the input to feed() is encoded using UTF-8. Defaults to True.  pyte.screens This module provides classes for terminal screens, currently it contains three screens with different features:  Screen – base screen implementation, which handles all the core escape sequences, recognized by Stream. If you need a screen to keep track of the changed lines (which you probably do need) – use DiffScreen. If you also want a screen to collect history and allow pagination – pyte.screen.HistoryScreen is here for ya ;) Note  It would be nice to split those features into mixin classes, rather than subclasses, but it’s not obvious how to do – feel free to submit a pull request.  copyright:	 2011-2012 by Selectel. copyright:	 (c) 2012-2017 by pyte authors and contributors, see AUTHORS for details.  license:	 LGPL, see LICENSE for more details.  pyte.screens.Screen classpyte.screens.Cursor(x, y, attrs=Char(data=' ', fg='default', bg='default', bold=False, italics=False, underscore=False, strikethrough=False, reverse=False, blink=False))[source] Screen cursor.  Parameters:	 x (int) – 0-based horizontal cursor position. y (int) – 0-based vertical cursor position. attrs (pyte.screens.Char) – cursor attributes (see select_graphic_rendition() for details). classpyte.screens.Char[source] A single styled on-screen character.  Parameters:	 data (str) – unicode character. Invariant: len(data) == 1. fg (str) – foreground colour. Defaults to "default". bg (str) – background colour. Defaults to "default". bold (bool) – flag for rendering the character using bold font. Defaults to False. italics (bool) – flag for rendering the character using italic font. Defaults to False. underscore (bool) – flag for rendering the character underlined. Defaults to False. strikethrough (bool) – flag for rendering the character with a strike-through line. Defaults to False. reverse (bool) – flag for swapping foreground and background colours during rendering. Defaults to False. blink (bool) – flag for rendering the character blinked. Defaults to False. classpyte.screens.Screen(columns, lines)[source] A screen is an in-memory matrix of characters that represents the screen display of the terminal. It can be instantiated on its own and given explicit commands, or it can be attached to a stream and will respond to events.  buffer A sparse lines x columns Char matrix.  dirty A set of line numbers, which should be re-drawn. The user is responsible for clearing this set when changes have been applied.  >>> screen = Screen(80, 24) >>> screen.dirty.clear() >>> screen.draw("!") >>> list(screen.dirty) [0] New in version 0.7.0.  cursor Reference to the Cursor object, holding cursor position and attributes.  margins Margins determine which screen lines move during scrolling (see index() and reverse_index()). Characters added outside the scrolling region do not make the screen to scroll.  The value is None if margins are set to screen boundaries, otherwise – a pair 0-based top and bottom line indices.  charset Current charset number; can be either 0 or 1 for G0 and G1 respectively, note that G0 is activated by default.  Note  According to ECMA-48 standard, lines and columns are 1-indexed, so, for instance ESC [ 10;10 f really means – move cursor to position (9, 9) in the display matrix.  Changed in version 0.4.7.  Warning  LNM is reset by default, to match VT220 specification. Unfortunatelly this makes pyte fail vttest for cursor movement.  Changed in version 0.4.8.  Warning  If DECAWM mode is set than a cursor will be wrapped to the beginning of the next line, which is the behaviour described in man console_codes.  See also  Standard ECMA-48, Section 6.1.1 for a description of the presentational component, implemented by Screen.  default_char An empty character with default foreground and background colors.  display A list() of screen lines as unicode strings.  reset()[source] Reset the terminal to its initial state.  Scrolling margins are reset to screen boundaries. Cursor is moved to home location – (0, 0) and its attributes are set to defaults (see default_char). Screen is cleared – each character is reset to default_char. Tabstops are reset to “every eight columns”. All lines are marked as dirty. Note  Neither VT220 nor VT102 manuals mention that terminal modes and tabstops should be reset as well, thanks to xterm – we now know that.  resize(lines=None, columns=None)[source] Resize the screen to the given size.  If the requested screen size has more lines than the existing screen, lines will be added at the bottom. If the requested size has less lines than the existing screen lines will be clipped at the top of the screen. Similarly, if the existing screen has less columns than the requested screen, columns will be added at the right, and if it has more – columns will be clipped at the right.  Parameters:	 lines (int) – number of lines in the new screen. columns (int) – number of columns in the new screen. Changed in version 0.7.0: If the requested screen size is identical to the current screen size, the method does nothing.  set_margins(top=None, bottom=None)[source] Select top and bottom margins for the scrolling region.  Parameters:	 top (int) – the smallest line number that is scrolled. bottom (int) – the biggest line number that is scrolled. set_mode(*modes, **kwargs)[source] Set (enable) a given list of modes.  Parameters:	modes (list) – modes to set, where each mode is a constant from pyte.modes. reset_mode(*modes, **kwargs)[source] Reset (disable) a given list of modes.  Parameters:	modes (list) – modes to reset – hopefully, each mode is a constant from pyte.modes. define_charset(code, mode)[source] Define G0 or G1 charset.  Parameters:	 code (str) – character set code, should be a character from "B0UK", otherwise ignored. mode (str) – if "(" G0 charset is defined, if ")" – we operate on G1. Warning  User-defined charsets are currently not supported.  shift_in()[source] Select G0 character set.  shift_out()[source] Select G1 character set.  draw(data)[source] Display decoded characters at the current cursor position and advances the cursor if DECAWM is set.  Parameters:	data (str) – text to display. Changed in version 0.5.0: Character width is taken into account. Specifically, zero-width and unprintable characters do not affect screen state. Full-width characters are rendered into two consecutive character containers.  set_title(param)[source] Set terminal title.  Note  This is an XTerm extension supported by the Linux terminal.  set_icon_name(param)[source] Set icon name.  Note  This is an XTerm extension supported by the Linux terminal.  carriage_return()[source] Move the cursor to the beginning of the current line.  index()[source] Move the cursor down one line in the same column. If the cursor is at the last line, create a new line at the bottom.  reverse_index()[source] Move the cursor up one line in the same column. If the cursor is at the first line, create a new line at the top.  linefeed()[source] Perform an index and, if LNM is set, a carriage return.  tab()[source] Move to the next tab space, or the end of the screen if there aren’t anymore left.  backspace()[source] Move cursor to the left one or keep it in its position if it’s at the beginning of the line already.  save_cursor()[source] Push the current cursor position onto the stack.  restore_cursor()[source] Set the current cursor position to whatever cursor is on top of the stack.  insert_lines(count=None)[source] Insert the indicated # of lines at line with cursor. Lines displayed at and below the cursor move down. Lines moved past the bottom margin are lost.  Parameters:	count – number of lines to insert. delete_lines(count=None)[source] Delete the indicated # of lines, starting at line with cursor. As lines are deleted, lines displayed below cursor move up. Lines added to bottom of screen have spaces with same character attributes as last line moved up.  Parameters:	count (int) – number of lines to delete. insert_characters(count=None)[source] Insert the indicated # of blank characters at the cursor position. The cursor does not move and remains at the beginning of the inserted blank characters. Data on the line is shifted forward.  Parameters:	count (int) – number of characters to insert. delete_characters(count=None)[source] Delete the indicated # of characters, starting with the character at cursor position. When a character is deleted, all characters to the right of cursor move left. Character attributes move with the characters.  Parameters:	count (int) – number of characters to delete. erase_characters(count=None)[source] Erase the indicated # of characters, starting with the character at cursor position. Character attributes are set cursor attributes. The cursor remains in the same position.  Parameters:	count (int) – number of characters to erase. Note  Using cursor attributes for character attributes may seem illogical, but if recall that a terminal emulator emulates a type writer, it starts to make sense. The only way a type writer could erase a character is by typing over it.  erase_in_line(how=0, private=False)[source] Erase a line in a specific way.  Character attributes are set to cursor attributes.  Parameters:	 how (int) – defines the way the line should be erased in:  0 – Erases from cursor to end of line, including cursor position. 1 – Erases from beginning of line to cursor, including cursor position. 2 – Erases complete line. private (bool) – when True only characters marked as eraseable are affected not implemented. erase_in_display(how=0, *args, **kwargs)[source] Erases display in a specific way.  Character attributes are set to cursor attributes.  Parameters:	 how (int) – defines the way the line should be erased in:  0 – Erases from cursor to end of screen, including cursor position. 1 – Erases from beginning of screen to cursor, including cursor position. 2 and 3 – Erases complete display. All lines are erased and changed to single-width. Cursor does not move. private (bool) – when True only characters marked as eraseable are affected not implemented. Changed in version 0.8.1: The method accepts any number of positional arguments as some clear implementations include a ; after the first parameter causing the stream to assume a 0 second parameter.  set_tab_stop()[source] Set a horizontal tab stop at cursor position.  clear_tab_stop(how=0)[source] Clear a horizontal tab stop.  Parameters:	how (int) – defines a way the tab stop should be cleared:  0 or nothing – Clears a horizontal tab stop at cursor position. 3 – Clears all horizontal tab stops. ensure_hbounds()[source] Ensure the cursor is within horizontal screen bounds.  ensure_vbounds(use_margins=None)[source] Ensure the cursor is within vertical screen bounds.  Parameters:	use_margins (bool) – when True or when DECOM is set, cursor is bounded by top and and bottom margins, instead of [0; lines - 1]. cursor_up(count=None)[source] Move cursor up the indicated # of lines in same column. Cursor stops at top margin.  Parameters:	count (int) – number of lines to skip. cursor_up1(count=None)[source] Move cursor up the indicated # of lines to column 1. Cursor stops at bottom margin.  Parameters:	count (int) – number of lines to skip. cursor_down(count=None)[source] Move cursor down the indicated # of lines in same column. Cursor stops at bottom margin.  Parameters:	count (int) – number of lines to skip. cursor_down1(count=None)[source] Move cursor down the indicated # of lines to column 1. Cursor stops at bottom margin.

Parameters:	count (int) – number of columns to skip. cursor_position(line=None, column=None)[source] Set the cursor to a specific line and column.  Cursor is allowed to move out of the scrolling region only when DECOM is reset, otherwise – the position doesn’t change.  Parameters:	 line (int) – line number to move the cursor to. column (int) – column number to move the cursor to. cursor_to_column(column=None)[source] Move cursor to a specific column in the current line.  Parameters:	column (int) – column number to move the cursor to. cursor_to_line(line=None)[source] Move cursor to a specific line in the current column.  Parameters:	line (int) – line number to move the cursor to. bell(*args)[source] Bell stub – the actual implementation should probably be provided by the end-user.  alignment_display()[source] Fills screen with uppercase E’s for screen focus and alignment.  select_graphic_rendition(*attrs)[source] Set display attributes.  Parameters:	attrs (list) – a list of display attributes to set. report_device_attributes(mode=0, **kwargs)[source] Report terminal identity.  New in version 0.5.0.  Changed in version 0.7.0: If private keyword argument is set, the method does nothing. This behaviour is consistent with VT220 manual.  report_device_status(mode)[source] Report terminal status or cursor position.  Parameters:	mode (int) – if 5 – terminal status, 6 – cursor position, otherwise a noop. New in version 0.5.0.  write_process_input(data)[source] Write data to the process running inside the terminal.  By default is a noop.  Parameters:	data (str) – text to write to the process stdin. New in version 0.5.0.  debug(*args, **kwargs)[source] Endpoint for unrecognized escape sequences.  By default is a noop.  pyte.screens.DiffScreen classpyte.screens.DiffScreen(*args, **kwargs)[source] A screen subclass, which maintains a set of dirty lines in its dirty attribute. The end user is responsible for emptying a set, when a diff is applied.  Deprecated since version 0.7.0: The functionality contained in this class has been merged into Screen and will be removed in 0.8.0. Please update your code accordingly.  pyte.screens.HistoryScreen classpyte.screens.History(top, bottom, ratio, size, position) classpyte.screens.HistoryScreen(columns, lines, history=100, ratio=0.5)[source] A :class:~`pyte.screens.Screen` subclass, which keeps track of screen history and allows pagination. This is not linux-specific, but still useful; see page 462 of VT520 User’s Manual.  Parameters:	 history (int) – total number of history lines to keep; is split between top and bottom queues. ratio (int) – defines how much lines to scroll on next_page() and prev_page() calls. history A pair of history queues for top and bottom margins accordingly; here’s the overall screen structure:  [ 1: .......] [ 2: .......]  <- top history [ 3: .......] ------------ [ 4: .......]  s [ 5: .......]  c [ 6: .......]  r [ 7: .......]  e [ 8: .......]  e [ 9: .......]  n ------------ [10: .......] [11: .......]  <- bottom history [12: .......] Note  Don’t forget to update Stream class with appropriate escape sequences – you can use any, since pagination protocol is not standardized, for example:  Stream.escape["N"] = "next_page" Stream.escape["P"] = "prev_page" before_event(event)[source] Ensure a screen is at the bottom of the history buffer.  Parameters:	event (str) – event name, for example "linefeed". after_event(event)[source] Ensure all lines on a screen have proper width (columns).  Extra characters are truncated, missing characters are filled with whitespace.  Parameters:	event (str) – event name, for example "linefeed". reset()[source] Overloaded to reset screen history state: history position is reset to bottom of both queues; queues themselves are emptied.  erase_in_display(how=0, *args, **kwargs)[source] Overloaded to reset history state.  index()[source] Overloaded to update top history with the removed lines.  reverse_index()[source] Overloaded to update bottom history with the removed lines.  prev_page()[source] Move the screen page up through the history buffer. Page size is defined by history.ratio, so for instance ratio = .5 means that half the screen is restored from history on page switch.  next_page()[source] Move the screen page down through the history buffer.  pyte.screens.DebugScreen classpyte.screens.DebugScreen(to=<_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stderr>' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>, only=())[source] A screen which dumps a subset of the received events to a file.  >>> import io >>> with io.StringIO() as buf: ...     stream = Stream(DebugScreen(to=buf)) ...     stream.feed("\x1b[1;24r\x1b[4l\x1b[24;1H\x1b[0;10m") ...     print(buf.getvalue()) ... ...  ["set_margins", [1, 24], {}] ["reset_mode", [4], {}] ["cursor_position", [24, 1], {}] ["select_graphic_rendition", [0, 10], {}] Parameters:	 to (file) – a file-like object to write debug information to. only (list) – a list of events you want to debug (empty by default, which means – debug all events). Warning  This is developer API with no backward compatibility guarantees. Use at your own risk!  pyte.modes This module defines terminal mode switches, used by Screen. There’re two types of terminal modes:  non-private which should be set with ESC [ N h, where N is an integer, representing mode being set; and private which should be set with ESC [ ? N h. The latter are shifted 5 times to the right, to be easily distinguishable from the former ones; for example Origin Mode – DECOM is 192 not 6.  >>> DECOM 192 copyright:	 2011-2012 by Selectel. copyright:	 (c) 2012-2017 by pyte authors and contributors, see AUTHORS for details.  license:	 LGPL, see LICENSE for more details.  pyte.modes.LNM= 20 Line Feed/New Line Mode: When enabled, causes a received LF, pyte.control.FF, or VT to move the cursor to the first column of the next line.  pyte.modes.IRM= 4 Insert/Replace Mode: When enabled, new display characters move old display characters to the right. Characters moved past the right margin are lost. Otherwise, new display characters replace old display characters at the cursor position.  pyte.modes.DECTCEM= 800 Text Cursor Enable Mode: determines if the text cursor is visible.  pyte.modes.DECSCNM= 160 Screen Mode: toggles screen-wide reverse-video mode.  pyte.modes.DECOM= 192 Origin Mode: allows cursor addressing relative to a user-defined origin.
