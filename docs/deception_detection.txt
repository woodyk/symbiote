"""
Purpose:
This script is designed to develop and refine an LLM-based framework for detecting 
deception in textual data. The focus of this session has been on implementing 
comprehensive linguistic, contextual, and fact-checking methodologies to enable 
robust analysis of potential deception. Key features include linguistic analysis, 
predictive checks using LLM output comparisons, and fact-checking against internal 
knowledge bases.

Project Context:
The session explored strategies to integrate advanced linguistic techniques, 
including Statement Analysis, pragmatic cues, and predictive divergence. 
This approach aligns with the project's goal of creating an adaptable and 
extendable system for identifying deception in text-based communication or 
transcripts. The framework also incorporates quantifiable scoring mechanisms 
to assess the likelihood of deception.

Structure and Key Components:
- **Core Analysis Methods**:
  1. Lexical and syntactic analysis for inconsistencies and unusual patterns.
  2. Emotional and cognitive load detection using sentence complexity and tone.
  3. Discourse analysis for context mismatches and narrative shifts.
  4. Pragmatic cue analysis (e.g., overconfidence, ambiguous statements).
  5. Fact-checking against known data to identify false or misleading claims.
  6. Predictive comparison: Using LLM predictions to identify divergence 
     between expected and actual text as potential deception markers.

- **Modular Methodology**:
  - All analysis methods are designed to be modular, allowing for easy 
    integration of new techniques or tools. Each method contributes to 
    an aggregate deception score.

- **Output Format**:
  - Summary of findings: Concise explanation of detected deceptive cues.
  - Chain of thought: Detailed reasoning behind each analysis step.
  - Deception score: Numerical evaluation between 0 and 1, with explanations.

- **Key Patterns and Styles**:
  - Clean, modular design for extensibility.
  - Emphasis on factual rigor and transparency in reasoning.
  - Integration of predictive modeling using LLMs for innovative analysis.

Functionality Implemented:
- Multi-layered deception analysis leveraging linguistic and fact-checking cues.
- Quantifiable metrics for evaluating the likelihood of deception.
- Predictive divergence analysis using LLM-generated sentence continuations.
- Fact-checking integration to verify claims within the text.
- Modular framework for scalable and reusable analysis techniques.

Guidelines for Extending the Project:
- To add new analysis methods: Implement as separate functions adhering 
  to modular conventions and integrate them into the core evaluation logic.
- To extend fact-checking: Leverage external APIs or updated knowledge 
  bases to enhance verification capabilities.
- To refine predictive divergence: Train the LLM with specific contexts or 
  fine-tune on domain-specific data for improved prediction accuracy.

Personal Style Alignment:
- Designed to reflect a clean, structured, and logically grouped architecture.
- Modular, extensible codebase to accommodate future enhancements.
- Clear documentation to facilitate seamless onboarding or handoff.

This reusable framework ensures that future development and analysis maintain 
consistency with the methodologies and design philosophies established here.

Project Purpose:
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive and scalable framework for
analyzing text for potential deception. The session has emphasized methods
for sentiment and emotion analysis, anomaly detection, and automated scoring
to identify deceptive patterns in text. The implementation is tailored for
modularity, extensibility, and integration with various input sources.

File/Code Structure:
- Modular functions encapsulate specific responsibilities, such as text
  preprocessing, emotion analysis, anomaly detection, and scoring.
- Integration with YouTube transcript extraction, local files, and URL-based
  text input ensures versatility in data sources.
- Analysis output includes human-readable summaries and structured JSON
  for programmatic consumption.
- Visualizations, such as bar charts and scatter plots, provide insights into
  emotion distributions and anomaly detection over time.

Methodologies and Conventions:
- Emphasis on modularity: Each function addresses a distinct aspect of the
  analysis pipeline, enhancing clarity and maintainability.
- Standardized JSON formatting for structured data output, ensuring compatibility
  with downstream systems or tools.
- Deception scoring integrates multiple factors, such as emotional baseline
  deviation (EBD), emotional inconsistency (EI), and contextual anomalies.
- Best practices for handling dependencies, such as leveraging `transformers`
  and `plotly` for NLP and visualizations, respectively.

Functionality Implemented:
- Automatic transcript extraction using `YouTubeTranscriptApi`.
- Chunking text for NLP tasks using `transformers` tokenization.
- Emotion and sentiment analysis via `j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`.
- Anomaly detection using `LocalOutlierFactor`, `IsolationForest`, and z-score
  analysis for emotional score variations.
- Comprehensive scoring mechanism combining emotional and contextual anomalies
  for deception detection.
- Summarized output including:
  - Average, maximum, and minimum deception scores.
  - Proportion of high deception chunks.
  - Detailed findings in human-readable format and JSON.

Key Styles and Preferences:
- Human-readable outputs are aligned to maximize interpretability and include
  tabulated formatting for clarity.
- JSON outputs follow a structured and normalized approach for programmatic
  extensibility.
- Functions are designed to be reusable, with flexibility for scaling and adding
  new input sources or analysis techniques.

Guidelines for Extension:
- To add new input sources: Implement a parsing function similar to
  `download_transcript` or text preprocessing for URLs or local files.
- To include additional analysis techniques: Introduce new scoring
  methodologies or anomaly detection algorithms, integrating them into the
  overall deception scoring mechanism.
- To extend visualizations: Utilize `plotly` for generating additional graphs,
  ensuring template consistency and readability.

Reusable Prompt Format for LLMs:
"You are an expert in deception detection and NLP analysis. Your task is to
analyze the provided text for emotions, sentiment, and anomalies. Provide
both a detailed summary of your findings and a structured JSON output.
Integrate multi-dimensional scoring to evaluate the likelihood of deception,
incorporating factors such as emotional shifts, sentiment variations, and
logical inconsistencies. Ensure outputs are clear, actionable, and extensible."

Notes:
- The current implementation aligns with a preference for clean, logically
  grouped functions and standardized outputs.
- JSON outputs should be formatted for downstream processing.
- Visualizations are optional but recommended for better interpretability.
